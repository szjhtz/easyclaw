/**
 * RivonClaw Runtime Context — prependSystemContext injection
 *
 * Uses the `before_prompt_build` hook to prepend RivonClaw runtime context
 * to the system prompt. This tells the AI it's inside RivonClaw and must
 * use `gateway`/`rivonclaw` tools instead of `openclaw` CLI commands.
 *
 * Uses `prependSystemContext` so the context is injected into the system
 * prompt layer (invisible to the user chat UI), not into the user message.
 *
 * The OpenClaw system prompt still contains the CLI Quick Reference section,
 * but the prepended context takes priority — the AI sees "do NOT use openclaw
 * CLI" before it sees the CLI instructions.
