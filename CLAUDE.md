## Workflow Rules

### Before Coding

- Read `docs/` (except `docs/ADR/`) to understand current state
- Treat `docs/PROGRESS.md` as the source of truth
- For new requirements or changes, update docs first, then implement code

### After Meaningful Work

- Update `docs/PROGRESS.md`
- Append to ADR if architectural decisions were made
- Run relevant unit tests

### Testing Requirements

- After finishing each item in `docs/PROGRESS.md`, always add and run unit tests
- After completing each phase in `docs/PROGRESS.md`, always add and run integration tests (if applicable)

### Restrictions

- Never assume undocumented behavior
- Do NOT auto-commit or push to git without explicit order
