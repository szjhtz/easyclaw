# CI/CD & Release

## Release Workflow

Releases use a **parallel** pipeline: CI builds installers while the developer runs local tests.

### Step 1: Bump version and push

Update version in `apps/desktop/package.json`, commit, push to `main`.

### Step 2: Run CI build + local tests in parallel

**CI (triggered manually):**
Trigger the "Build & Release" workflow via GitHub Actions `workflow_dispatch`.
This builds Mac DMG/ZIP + Windows EXE along with blockmap files and electron-updater manifests (`latest.yml`, `latest-mac.yml`), then creates a **draft** GitHub Release with all artifacts attached.

**Local (on developer machine):**
```bash
./scripts/test-local.sh           # full pipeline: build + unit tests + e2e dev + pack + e2e prod
./scripts/test-local.sh --skip-tests  # build + pack only
```

### Step 3: Publish the release

After both CI build and local tests complete successfully:

```bash
./scripts/publish-release.sh          # reads version from package.json
./scripts/publish-release.sh 1.2.8    # or specify explicitly
```

This validates the draft has at least 7 artifacts (DMG, ZIP, ZIP.blockmap, latest-mac.yml, EXE, EXE.blockmap, latest.yml), pushes the git tag `v{version}`, and promotes the draft release to public.

**Incremental updates:** The build generates `.blockmap` files and `latest.yml`/`latest-mac.yml` manifests that enable `electron-updater` differential downloads. Users only download changed ~64KB blocks instead of the full installer.

If local tests fail, delete the draft release on GitHub and fix the issues.

## GitHub Actions Workflows

| File | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `test-build.yml` | Push to `main` or PR | Verify builds compile on Windows + macOS (unsigned, no tests) |
| `build.yml` | Manual (`workflow_dispatch`) | Build signed installers + create draft GitHub Release |

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/test-local.sh` | Local build + full test suite (unit, e2e dev, e2e prod) |
| `scripts/publish-release.sh` | Publish a draft GitHub Release after CI + local tests pass |
| `scripts/rebuild-native.sh` | Prebuild better-sqlite3 for Node.js + Electron |

## File Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `RELEASE_BODY.md` | Template body appended to GitHub Releases |
| `SIGNPATH_SETUP.md` | Guide for free Windows code signing via SignPath Foundation |
| `CI_CD.md` | This file |

## Code Signing Status

| Platform | Signing | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **macOS** | Apple Developer | CI signing configured |
| **Windows** | SignPath Foundation | Pending setup (see `SIGNPATH_SETUP.md`) |

## Vendor Pruning

`dist:mac` / `dist:win` scripts automatically prune `vendor/openclaw/node_modules` before packaging to reduce installer size.

After building locally, restore full deps for development:
```bash
cd vendor/openclaw && CI=true pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile && cd ../..
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Native module errors**: Run `./scripts/rebuild-native.sh --force`
- **Build failures on CI**: Verify Node.js version matches (currently 24)
- **E2E test timeouts**: Ensure no stale EasyClaw processes are running
